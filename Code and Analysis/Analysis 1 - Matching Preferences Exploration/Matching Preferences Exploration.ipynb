are you experiencing growth in your relationship with yourself and others? how are you growing, and how are your relationships growing as a result? what are you putting your heart on and what is most important to you?  my life feels full and real. i am open and paying attention (i do my best). i welcome you to question my thoughts, motivations and actions because i want to know you. most of my friendships are long-term and stand the test of time. i am fortunate to have a very select group of people who are my friends and know most everything about me. i have close contact with my family as well. i believe our lives are about relationships. my friendships and relationships are very close and intimate. this means there is an honesty and trust present that allows us to be who we are no matter what. we work it out and our bond deepens as a result.  i am seeking this kind of relationship with a lover as well. i'm not looking for perfection. i just want a relationship where someone is paying close attention and wants to learn and grow. this means sometimes we will encounter struggles and difficulties and we have awareness that the way we handled these challenges today has improved immensely from how we have handled them in the past.  i have spent much time alone and have benefitted tremendously. i enjoy myself and am okay being alone, however, i have come to realize when i am happiest i am deeply involved in a relationship with a lover filled with intimacy, passion and awareness.  i am studying to be a nurse. while doing so i am working with my family, and with a national non-profit organization that inspires me. i find myself looking at the organization and it's success while at the same time looking at it's antiquated terminology and how the language used within the organization holds them back. i am examining my mind and heart to see how i can contribute and perhaps steer them in a direction where the language they use represents the more positive aspects of the organization as well as the consumers they serve. i enjoy analyzing the anatomy and physiology of organizations, observing where they are infected systemically, and approaching the institution with quality care improvement suggestions from the leadership down.  i grew up in a family very drawn to the arts. my dad was a television director and eventually landed in advertising representing semiconductor companies shortly after this area became high-tech heaven, and was coined the silicon valley. he retired to spain just after my daughter was born seventeen years ago. my daughter will be a senior in high school soon and now lives with her dad. i have two brothers. my older brother was a ranger in the u.s. army and has a strong interest in photography, and my younger brother makes his living as an essayist, sports journalist, and documentary filmmaker. i love photography as well. i once started making a short film (i still have 48 hours of footage) but i never finished. the subject matter is timeless so maybe someday. in my early twenties most of my experience with photography was in front of the camera and more recently i enjoy being behind the lens documenting life in still shots, doing collage, and making cards. it's fun and a way for me to share my life with those i love. one of my friendships that i appreciate the most is a relationship through pictures. a friend from college lives in washington and we communicate almost daily (not through a social network) via images. it's inspiring and i love the simplicity of her life. it reminds me of the amish.  i love being a mom and have a better relationship with my daughter's father now than i did when we were together. we share 50% custody and both volunteer our time where she goes to school. he's the la crosse coach and i am the team parent keeping score at all the games and making baked goods as often as i can. i wish i would have had more children but time passed by so quickly and here i am. i suppose a miracle is possible but at this point (i'm almost 45) it's probably unlikely. i have been raising my daughter alone since she was almost two so i do not know what it is like to be with someone and share all the experiences that come with having a loving relationship and family. it's one of my biggest regrets.  my photos are about a year and a half old. my older brother took them in san francisco one day. i wasn't wearing any makeup (i'm not big into makeup) and it was just a day where we were hanging out together. we plan to spend time together at a museum in the next couple weeks and i asked him if he would take some more. so, i will post some new ones soon. recently, i met someone and he said, you're the only one who looks like their pictures. that being said, i feel like they authentically represent who i am.  all my best to you,  lisa\",\n",

       "  'so, preferring depth to breadth, here are four stories.....  i\\'m half french- on my mom\\'s side. in france there is a widely held suspicion that belgians are a bit dim. as i wasn\\'t raised bilingually, when i go to france i find myself regularly speaking with completely incorrect grammar but with no trace of an accent. so in the midst of asking questions like \"how much costs one comma five kilograms of cheese\" or \"where i can garage my car\" with the accent of a native speaker... i seem to consistently give the impression that i\\'m either semi-retarded or possibly visiting from belgium. my family there, at least, knows better (or should). i sometimes have difficulty expressing what\\'s inside, but i enjoy (and keep) trying.  i\\'ve always had a strong aesthetic sense and balk at the notion, conveyed in shows like \"queer eye\", that straight men are somehow incapable of dressing, designing, or laying out living spaces for themselves (though cooking for myself is an ongoing project). a year ago i took a pottery class as a fluke and fell in love. pottery has become a minor obsession. i love the embodied-ness of pottery- the way in roots me right there- and the few simple design decisions involved... form, function, color. lately i\\'ve gotten into an old-school japanese form of glazing called raku. the technique is one part teamwork, one part pyromania, and one part christmas morning- digging pots out of piles of incinerated newspaper-lined trash cans and cleaning them off. the result is an organic cracked, fractured look that can directly express the beauty of imperfection. (speaking of imperfection, i also love to play acoustic guitar and sing... modestly outdated folks like ben harper, dave matthews, and john mayer. i need to find someone with whom to harmonize... as it were.)  three years ago, during some time off, i decided i would really love to have a dog and it was go time. one evening i happened to catch two tv shows about dogs- pbs specials. having just been immersed in all things canine, i went to sleep. i woke up the next morning with the name molly in my head. without any context or explanation, i immediately put the dream out of my mind. six weeks later, after several regular trips to the local dog shelter, i arrived in the morning and saw what seemed to be the ideal candidate.... a mid-sized, calm girl- supremely, almost impossibly sweet. when i asked the supervisor, whom i\\'d gotten to know well, about the dog, she told me excitedly that she\\'d just arrived and was the perfect pet for me. she told me her name was molly. i remembered in a flash and snatched her up. she\\'s great. i\\'m still opening to trusting the emotional and intuitive parts of myself and learning to give this side its substantial due.  i\\'ve been teaching and practicing internal medicine for about ten years at an academic hospital in palo alto (a younger still unshaven version of house sans the narcotic addiction). my passion for medicine and education has been shifting for some time, and i\\'m seriously considering an additional vocation involving trans-personal/depth psychology. the process of investigating what\\'s true for me and how that effects how i relate, know, and feel- and watching that evolve in others- holds a lot of energy for me. how western medicine and eastern psychology might coalesce into one gestalt is still a mystery.',\n",

(and if you look over there to right it says i'm a vegetarian - which when you reconcile with hunting wild cattle on a small island points to the functional contradictions thing i started with).  i used to think it was very important to communicate fully, now i think it's much more important to communicate well. when there's so much to say, pointing at the moon can be better than a wikipedia article about the moon (that's me pointing right there).  i'm pretty intense in conversation even so, but it's the inquiry or the finding things out that is important to me. i think it is easy to mistake competitiveness with intensity - i'd say i have a lot of the latter and only some of the former.  that said, i do enjoy aimless discourse, humor and sometimes talking about how we are put together (specifically each of us and also the general). i'm also pretty affectionate, though it takes some breaking of ice for me.  i care for and have kept some close friendships in my life for 25 years. but i still make new friends, though with my life at the moment it's often through work (my work is complicated).\",\n",
